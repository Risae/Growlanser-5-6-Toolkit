# Growlanser 5 & 6 Toolkit

Work-In-Progress Growlanser 5 and 6 Toolkit, written in Python.

Currently only works on Windows x64/x86.

Python embeddable package, Strawberry Perl, abcde & quickBMS are inside the folder "00_3rd_Party_Programs", and it "should" work out of the box, even if you don't have Python installed.
