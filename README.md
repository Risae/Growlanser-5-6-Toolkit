# Growlanser 5 & 6 Toolkit

Work-In-Progress Growlanser 5 and 6 Toolkit, written in Python.

Currently only works on Windows x64/x86.

The following dependencies exist:

- Python scripts = Python 3.9
- abcde = Perl
- quickBMS = Windows x64/x86 OS

Python embeddable package, Strawberry Perl, abcde & quickBMS are inside the folder "00_3rd_Party_Programs".
Everything "should" work out of the box, even if you don't have Python installed.
Temporary PATHs will be created that point to the programs inside the folder "00_3rd_Party_Programs" so Python and Perl (abcde) scripts work.
